# Express Project Starter

The Express Project Starter is a comprehensive, highly scalable API framework designed to facilitate rapid development of web applications and services. Crafted with the powerful Express.js framework at its core, this project serves as a foundational platform for developers looking to build advanced, feature-rich applications.

With out-of-the-box support for CRUD operations, the framework enables seamless data management and manipulation. It is engineered to support a wide array of applications, from customer and administrative data handling to more complex data interaction scenarios requiring sophisticated business logic.

## Features

1. **Versatile Data Handling**: Provides robust support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, catering to a broad spectrum of data management requirements.
2. **Advanced Security**: Incorporates state-of-the-art security features, including JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication, bcrypt for secure password hashing, and protections against common vulnerabilities such as XSS attacks and HTTP Parameter Pollution.
3. **AWS S3 Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Amazon S3 for scalable storage solutions, enabling efficient management of data and media assets.
4. **Environmental Configuration**: Utilizes dotenv for easy management of environment-specific configurations, enhancing security and adaptability across different deployment environments.
5. **Comprehensive Middleware Support**: Offers a rich set of middleware options for rate limiting, CORS support, file uploads, real-time interactions via Socket.io, and more, enhancing functionality and user experience.
6. **Optimized Performance**: Implements response compression and Morgan logging for improved application performance and easier maintenance.
7. **Database Integration**: Features a ready-to-use MongoDB setup with Mongoose for sophisticated data modeling and seamless database interactions.
8. **Extensible Architecture**: Designed with modularity at its core, allowing for straightforward expansion and customization to accommodate the needs of various applications.


## Packages

- **Express Framework**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Easily manage AWS S3 buckets with `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/lib-storage`.
- **Authentication & Security**: Utilizes `bcrypt` for hashing and `jsonwebtoken` for secure token-based authentication.
- **Data Validation**: Leverages `express-validator` for request validation.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against brute-force attacks with `express-rate-limit`.
- **CORS Support**: Configured with `cors` to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **File Upload**: Supports file uploading with `express-fileupload`.
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Incorporates `socket.io` for real-time web applications.
- **Logging**: Integrated with `morgan` for HTTP request logging.
- **Compression**: Uses `compression` for response body compression.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implements various HTTP headers for app security with `helmet` and `helmet-csp`.
- **Prevention of Parameter Pollution**: Guards against HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks with `hpp`.
- **Redis Integration**: Features `redis` for caching and session management.
- **Database**: Connects to MongoDB using `mongoose` for data modeling.
- **Environment Variables**: Configured with `dotenv` for environment variable management.
- **UUID Generation**: Includes `uuid` for generating unique identifiers.
- **XSS Protection**: Utilizes `xss` to sanitize input and prevent XSS attacks.

```

## Developing New Features

### Creating Routes
1. To add new routes to the application:

Navigate to the routes directory.
Creating Routes
To add new routes to the application:

Navigate to the routes directory.
Create a new file for your route, e.g., `users.js`, to handle user-related routes.
Inside the route file, import Express and create a router:
```
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
```

2. Define routes using `router.get()`, `router.post()`, `router.put()`, `router.delete()` and specify callback functions or import them from controllers.
```
const { getUsers, createUser } = require('../controllers/userController');
router.get('/', getUsers);
router.post('/', createUser);
```
3. Export the router at the end of the file:
```
module.exports = router;
```
4. Import and use the new route in `app.js` or your main server file:
```
const usersRoutes = require('./routes/users');
app.use('/api/users', usersRoutes);
```

### Creating Controllers
To create controllers for handling business logic:

Navigate to the controllers directory.
Create a new controller file, e.g., `userController.js`.
In the controller file, define functions for each operation you wish to perform, such as fetching data, creating a new record, etc.
```
exports.getUsers = (req, res) => {
    // Logic to fetch and return users
};

exports.createUser = (req, res) => {
    // Logic to create a new user
};
```
Export these functions to be used in route files.

### Creating Models
To define models for your database schemas:

Navigate to the models directory.
Create a new model file, e.g., User.js, for each data model.
Define the schema using Mongoose and create a model:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
    password: String,
    // Define other fields as necessary
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```
Import and use these models in your controllers to interact with the database.
